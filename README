Adds checkboxes to each field in the Add Items dialog so that they are
not cleared after clicking add.

I personally use this for adding a few sentences from the same place,
to avoid having to type/paste the same URL or title into my "Source"
field multiple times.

See http://sartak.org/misc/anki-add.png for this plugin and
"Add Suspended" in action.
